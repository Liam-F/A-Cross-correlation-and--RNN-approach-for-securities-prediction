# A-Cross-correlation-and-machine-learning-approach-for-securities-prediction  
The research is still undergoing, will be releasing soon.  
Some Ideas:  
* when making a prediction, one should perceive the world as a whole.  
* information flows (or pulse) always take time to transport, and the time could be measured by corss-correlation.  
* the exist of auto correlation would corrupt the cross correlation information and thus need to be preprocessed. 
* Recurrent neural network or SVM is good at capturing hidden relation without making much assumptions.
